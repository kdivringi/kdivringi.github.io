I've also programmed for fun since high school. It's always been in my free time and I've done everything from website, smartphone apps and GUI software. I recently completed a Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree. I wrote a software package Any2Ans that couples ANSYS and Anybody software. I've recently written a paid extension for ANSYS called Simulation Notebook that brings the sophisticated data analysis tools that I've learned to FEA simulations.
