      <p>Recently I've been catching up on my web technologies. I've always liked the way you can put together universal and programmatic documents with HTML and web applications. I remember turning my nose up to Django and contributing to  Turbogears (if anyone remembers that) back in the day. I've also used JQuery several times to make my own little dynamic web pages and widgets. These were all one-off, not often re-used and I felt very cool about them. It looks like web technology has gone through a sea change, though, and I wanted to keep up. I often make little dashboards and have been increasingly using web pages as a universal GUI and with things like <a href="http://electron.atom.io/">Project Electron</a> that seemed to apply more than ever.</p>
<p>My learning path:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/">Eloquent Javascript</a>: I got this through a humble book bundle but you can also read it for free online. I did not to all, or even many, of the exercises but it was instrumental in taking Javascript from an unfamiliar language that I was fighting to a genuinely useful tool.</li>
<li><a href="http://reactfordesigners.com/labs/reactjs-introduction-for-people-who-know-just-enough-jquery-to-get-by/">React.js Introduction For People Who Know Just Enough jQuery To Get By</a>: A nice, not too heavy, introduction as to the place of React and similar frameworks. React seems complex and jQuery is easy to understand and get things done with very quickly but this article does a good job in both introducing React and the need for React. It also lead me to the next step below:</li>
<li><a href="https://reactforbeginners.com/">Wes Bos's React for Beginners</a>: A nice, focused course on building a React Web Application. It is an objectively crazy pace. Much of it feels like a whirlwind tour and there are depths of things that are skipped or glossed over completely and many times I stopped to ask the question: "Whaaaaa?" But there is right now a great background of web technologies that it would be foolish to try and cover everything. The is necessarily focused on React and it does that well. Very time efficient too, as I was able to get through it in a few afternoons.</li>
<li><a href="http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/">Learn HTML/CSS by Shay Howe</a>: I've always used Bootstrap for just about everything I've done and it has always seemed a bit magic. For my next project I decided to do the CSS on my own. Also it was a nice opportunity to get introduced to those newfangled HTML5 tags.</li>
</ul>
<p>The result of all the above is a new version of the <a href="http://kdivringi.github.io/krypto/">Krypto Game</a>. The previous version (<a href="http://kdivringi.github.io/kryptoOld/">still available here</a>) was a bit of a mess, with spaghetti Javascript code, jQuery because I didn't know different and Bootstrap for CSS. This one uses React and my own CSS (apart from resets and gradient generators).</p>
<p>They are about the same size, surprisingly. Actually the old version, that includes all of jQuery and Bootstrap and my unminified code would probably be smaller if I minified my code. A little over 50% of the new version is due to  webfonts. I don't regret it, though, they had the single greatest effect in making it look better.</p>
<p>Look forward to using modern web technologies more!</p>

      <p>It's been awhile and I've been busy, if not necessarily on this blog. A quick rundown:</p>
<h1>Projects</h1>
<ul>
<li>Simulation Notebook: You can see the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXDiK9ojJvo">video</a> from my portfolio. This is something that is tremendously exciting to me but I am having trouble finding the time to develop it further or even market it. It's been a busy year!</li>
<li><a href="/krypto/">Krypto</a>: Recently I've been brushing up on my Javascript (see the Books section) so I can be more confident in presenting dynamic content on the web. This is the first project that I've used some of the object oriented features of the language. The code is a bit disorganized but it was some good practice in building something new in a somewhat lesser known language for me. I hope to be more confident building interactivity into some webpages with what I've learned (see Bokeh section below).</li>
<li>Kaggle: There is a Kaggle dataset that has taken my fancy of late: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/septa/on-time-performance">The SEPTA On Time Performance Dataset</a>. Right now I have a very basic kernel and a forum post in which I confuse days for hours but more is coming!</li>
</ul>
<h1>Books</h1>
<p>I'm a bit weird in that I like reading not just books but programming books for fun. A few notables from my plate:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2cZI18W">Fluent Python</a>: <em>Excellent</em> book, just excellent. I know Python and have been working with it for some number of years. This book, however, opened my eyes to some of the inner workings and underlying design decisions that make Python such a pleasure to work with. Areas of the language that seemed obtuse to me before were presented with opinionated context and through the gradual buildup I understood concepts that I previously found confusing. Also, more importantly, I got valuable context on when 'not' to use advanced features, avoiding the "Everything looks like a nail" situation. Great intermediate Python book.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2d1BwWi">Algorithms to Live By</a>: Self-help with programming? Such an odd but delightful concept but it makes sense that we can apply all of the research done in computer algorithms to our day to day lives. The best organization system is a pile (LRU Cache). You can vastly improve your predictions of the future by first selecting one of three probability distributions. Being in a rut in life is just a local minima that can be overcome with an injection of randomness. I cannot overstate how much I liked this book.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2cZILed">Eloquent Javascript</a>: I got this in the humble programming bundle. Great supposedly introductory book that quickly ramps up in difficulty. I will go back and review certain of the chapters but I highly enjoyed it.</li>
<li><a href="https://sublimetextbook.com/">Sublime Text Power User</a>: I've had the paid version of SublimeText for some time now but I've never really put it through it's paces. I hope to fully come up to speed with this book + video lectures.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Links</h1>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://tomaugspurger.github.io/modern-1.html">Modern Pandas</a>: Goes beyond the basics and presents how to use Pandas in a thoughtful, <em>pandorable</em> way. A nice intermediate tutorial</li>
<li><a href="http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/">Brandon Rhodes Tutorials</a>: An excellent lecturer, clear explanations and good presentations. I found the Pandas and SQL tutorials quite nice for brushing up and becoming cleaner with tools that I already know.</li>
<li><a href="http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/">Bokeh</a>: I find the architecture of this young project fascinating and powerful. Really looking forward to getting into it more. At my work, where programming is not a major focus, the static but interactive html documents it produces have been killer for me. I used to think that you needed a backend server to have most types of widgets/interactivity but <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/pjbutcher/d/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data/interactive-visualization-with-python?forumMessageId=131220#131220">it looks like you can also accomplish this by using more Javascript</a>. A major motivator in my learning of Javascript more deeply.</li>
<li><a href="http://connor-johnson.com/2014/02/18/linear-regression-with-python/">Linear Regression With Python</a>: Nothing too earth shattering here but I highly appreciated the explanation of those other terms from a regression analysis in statsmodels :)</li>

      <p>Looking for an interactive visualization? <a href="/d3-solar/index.html">Here you go!</a></p>
<p><img alt="Solar Visualization Thumbnail" src="/images/SolarExploration.gif" title="Solar Exploration Interactive Visualization" /></p>
<p>This <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> site was originally created just to host my Solar Exploration Timeline visualization done in D3 for my Udacity Nanodegree. I couldn't put it on <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/">bl.ocks.org</a> because of the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/">Bootstrap</a> formatting that I used.</p>
<p>Now that I made this site a thing, you can find our previously featured visualization <a href="/d3-solar/index.html">here</a>. Enjoy clicking and zooming around the solar system!</p>
