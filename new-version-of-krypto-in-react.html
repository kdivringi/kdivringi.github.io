    <p>Recently I've been catching up on my web technologies. I've always liked the way you can put together universal and programmatic documents with HTML and web applications. I remember turning my nose up to Django and contributing to  Turbogears (if anyone remembers that) back in the day. I've also used JQuery several times to make my own little dynamic web pages and widgets. These were all one-off, not often re-used and I felt very cool about them. It looks like web technology has gone through a see change, though, and I wanted to keep up. I often make little dashboards and have been increasingly using web pages as a universal GUI and with things like <a href="http://electron.atom.io/">Project Electron</a> that seemed to apply more than ever.</p>
<p>My learning path:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/">Eloquent Javascript</a>: I got this through a humble book bundle but you can also read it for free online. I did not to all, or even many, of the exercises but it was instrumental in taking Javascript from an unfamiliar language that I was fighting to a genuinely useful tool.</li>
<li><a href="http://reactfordesigners.com/labs/reactjs-introduction-for-people-who-know-just-enough-jquery-to-get-by/">React.js Introduction For People Who Know Just Enough jQuery To Get By</a>: A nice, not too heavy, introduction as to the place of React and similar frameworks.

It also lead me to the next step below:</li>

<p>The result of all the above is a new version of the <a href="http://kdivringi.github.io/krypto/">Krypto Game</a>.
